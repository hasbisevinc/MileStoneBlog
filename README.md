# How to Use:
### 1) Installing MongoDB
If you have a mongodb running on your server, you can skip this section.
To install mongoDB into centos: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-centos-7
### 2) Cloning/Downloading Project
> git clone https://github.com/hasbisevinc/MileStoneBlog.git

or download it with **Download** button on github page.

Now, you will have backend and frontend folders. Backend contains our api functions that connect to mongoDB. Frontend folder contains blog and admin page ui with required JS files.

### 3) Edit Files
#### cross-origin settings
- Go to MileStoneBlog/backend directory and open server.js with your favorite text editor.
- Change urls in the origin section on line 12.
> If your website and backend urls are stored in different domains, make sure, you have write all combination of your web site url. Otherwise, you cannot connect backend from your website.

#### DB URL

> default url usually 
> const  url  =  "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"

#### API URL
- Go to MileStoneBlog/frontend/js and open config.js with your favorite text editor.
- Change **API_URL** variable with url that will be indicate your backend.
> for example:  
> var  API_URL  =  "http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000/"

### 4)Upload Backend Files Into Your Server
- Upload backend files into your server. Go to root directory of backend (/MileStoneBlog/backend)
- Start backend script
- install np2 (to run backend server in the background as a service)
> npm install -g pm2
- start server
> cd MileStoneBlog/backend/
pm2 start server.js

### 5)Upload Frontend Files Into Your Server

# Technologies
- Thanks to [Vertical Timeline project of CodyHouse](https://github.com/CodyHouse/vertical-timeline)
- Icon Set [Font Awesome](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG/tree/master/white/svg)
- Backend has been developed with NodeJS and frontend has been developed with pure JS

# Future Works & Limitations
- We cannot set title (person name), subtitle and other basic information (yet)
- We should implement a text editor to long text (enabling HTML tags)
- We should hide "read more" button if there is no long body text

# Troubleshooting
## Cannot Connecting Backend
- Make sure your firewall not blocking the backend. To allow 8000 port:
> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT
- Make sure your cross-origin settings allow connection
- Make sure mangoDB url is right
## Cannot Connecting Frontend
- Make sure you upload frontend files to right directory via FTP
## Others
- Please open a bug on Github
